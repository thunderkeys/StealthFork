## About  

Stealth Fork is an experimental design that blends the awesome aesthetic and compact form factor of the [**Micron+ R1**](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/R1_Beta) with the fixed gantry of the [**Salad Fork**.](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Salad_Fork) If you‚Äôve ever wanted a machine that blends the best of both, this is it.  

### Additional Features Ported from Micron:
- Bottom panel as stock
- Dual shear add-ons for A/B motors
- Pinned variants of A/B & X/Y as stock
- Optimised belt path
- Larger feet for more stability
- 3.5-inch / 4.3-inch display mounts as stock
- 2x Keystone mounts in rear skirt
- Stealthy aesthetics

> **Note:** This repository is a work in progress. I'll be updating it as things evolve. The goal is a seamless build experience, without compromising the high standards of either parent design.

## Current Status  

- ‚úÖ **STLs Uploaded** ‚Äì All required STLs for a 180mm or 160mm build are included.
- üîú **CAD Files Coming Soon** ‚Äì Once files are cleaned up, they'll be added (Skirt CAD files available).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beta Release** ‚Äì While all parts have been printed successfully, a full assembly is still pending. Expect minor refinements.
